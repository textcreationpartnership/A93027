            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was about the time when the Tavern Doors were ſhut up, and all Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals were retir'd to their reſt, ſave the Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He ſeem'd like the Emblem of Envy, his Hairs turned into Serpents, his Tap into a Pump, ſpouting with Sulphur and corroded Poiſon, with a long Veil of Hypocriſie Ermin'd and Spoted with Blood.</p>
            <p>In this Gaſly-ſight he appear'd by my Bed-ſide, where after a ſtrong debauch of <hi>French</hi> VVine, and <hi>Italian</hi> Love; falling into a pleaſant ſlumber, I began as uſually, to Dream of a Parliament, when thus the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> apply'd himſelf unto me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ghost.</hi> Thou Fool, thou flatters thy ſelf with the hopes of a <hi>Parliament;</hi> thou Prateſt, and Talkeſt, and Dreameſt of Parliaments, when they will make no more for Thee, then thou haſt made for the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> ſince thou turn'd Hypocrite, and put on the <hi>Salamanca</hi> Robes.</p>
            <p>Aſtoniſh'd at the unexpected Spectre, in a bloody ſweat and panick fear, I crept under the ſmoaking Blankets, leaſt he came to Involve me and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a new Plot, or with a Summons, to fetch me into the other VVorld, when thus he apply'd himſelf to me.</p>
            <p>Fear not (Friend) thy time is not yet come, though thou ſcap'd the late Buttocking, thou ſhalt Reign a while, though it be but ſhort, we have uſe for ſuch neceſſary Inſtruments upon Earth, to bring our Projects to Perfection.</p>
            <p>Thou knoweſt (Doctor) how many Journeys thou haſt made to the <hi>Tower,</hi> when I was there, where we laid the foundation of all our Deſigns, and its but fit I ſhou'd make on Sally from Hell to give Thee thanks for the good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thou haſt done us. The Plot was well carried on at firſt, the Jeſuits was a clever Jobb, and we will Record Thee in our Eternal Rubricks. But for the Lords in the Tower, I am afraid, in this long Reſpeit, they will weather the Point, and out-live our Malice; but make uſe of the Artillery I gave thee, and thou may'ſt be able yet, with thy ſtock of Impudence, to venture a Broad-ſide amongſt'em.</p>

               <hi>Oats.</hi> At this, methought, I began to aſſume freſh Courage, and finding the Devil was not come to fetch me that very Inſtant, I began to argue with him as formerly, and asked of him, if he were Dead, or Alive? or if Dead where he was Diſpoſed of, or what Reward he had found in the other VVorld for all his Indefatigable Pains and Policy, when thus, (methought) with a shril Voice, and quivering Accent, he anſwered,</p>

'Tis true, I found the Fewel of a Plot, but thou with thy <hi>boreas</hi>-Noſe, and Blobber-Chaps, blew the Bellows, which kindled with a Cole of pretended Zeal from the Altar, Encreaſed it to ſuch a hight, that ſome fell a Sacrifice to thy fury; and what can thou expect but to fall a Sin-offering for the Blood that has been ſpilt.

            <p>
               <hi>Oats.</hi> Did not you, like a litle State-quack the Rables-Mountebank, give out every day upon the Stage your two Dozes of Slavery and Popery, which made the people run mad with mutiny and rebellion, to the forfeit of their Allegiance, had not the wise Phyſician of the State found an Antidot to expel your Poiſon.</p>

Have I not changed the City for the Court, the Court for the City, Union for Faction, Religion for Sedition, and do I not change my Religion every week with my Lodging? But I find all will not do, the Brethrens Charity is grown cold, and I am left like the Camelion, to the open Air, and for ought I ſee, am like to have no other Food.</p>
